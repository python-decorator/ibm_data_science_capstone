# IBM Data Science Capstone

## The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs.

Your presentation will develop into a story of all your data science journey in this project, and it should be compelling and easy to understand.
In the next exercise, you can find a provided PowerPoint template to help you get started to create a report in slides format.
However, you are free to add additional slides, charts, and tables.

Note that this presentation will be prepared for your peer-data-scientists whom are eager to understand every technical detail of this project.
As such, this presentation will be much more detailed and technical than regular high-level and abstracted presentation for your executive team.

Once you have completed a detailed report, it should be straightforward for you to abstract it into a high-level
deck for your executive team and/or stakeholders
